毕业十多年，大部分时间恰好在国内几个大厂工作，最近在思考这几段工作经历分别带给了自己什么？可以给想去大厂的同学一些什么建议？我尝试用自己的视角和大家聊聊。

## 创始人

当我们去聊一家公司时，首先绕不过的一个话题就是公司的创始人，创始人决定了一家公司的基因。马化腾、马云、张一鸣，显然不需要再花过多时间介绍这几个大家耳熟能详的人物，但我想再给大家回顾下这三位创始人在创办公司前的职业：马化腾和张一鸣都是软件工程师，而马云是大学老师，某种程度上，这决定了公司的基因和文化。

## 低调务实的腾讯

刚毕业进腾讯，无论是入职培训，还是马化腾Pony、或者其他高管的交流会，“用户体验”一定是共同、高频提及的一个话题。当你还是一张白纸，什么都不会的时候，公司就将用户为先的思想植入你的脑子。当然，好的方面显而易见，初入职场你就学习到了用户视角思维的良好习惯，但如果没有自我思考，很难说这一个点能帮助实现自我成长。这些公开场合对“用户体验”的重视，缺乏一些上下文的展开和关于优先级权衡的注解。

另外，腾讯是一个产品驱动的公司，除非你是在专注在技术支撑方向的团队，比如 TEG ，否则作为一名技术研发，你的日常工作应该都聚焦在产品需求的开发上。特别是在业务发展初期，技术的核心目标就是支撑好产品和业务，也许你会觉得所有公司都是这样，但是在腾讯，这可能是一种常态。作为技术人员，你会具备得天独厚的优势去积累业务 sense ，习惯和学会产品思维。但在行业内，这样的优势可能并不是一个典型的技术专家或管理需要具备的特质，你需要持续思考怎样通过技术输出价值。当然，在公司内部，帮助业务取得快速落地或突破，就可能让你获得发展和晋升。

## 外向热情的阿里

如果用人的性格来形容一家公司，腾讯是内向的社恐，那阿里一定是个社牛。体现在他的组织文化建设和强大的团队协作能力上。

每个新员工都会参加百年阿里的入职培训，培训过程中公司的整个发展历程，从做中国黄页开始，到成立阿里巴巴，再到淘宝天猫支付宝，其中的心酸曲折，高光华彩，都用影片的方式记录呈现，堪比大片，看着让人激动。另外“让天下没有难做的生意”的使命，六脉神剑的价值观在各种高管的布道下，也让人热血沸腾。他会让每个人都觉得自己在做着有意义的事情，在为世界做出美好的改变。

我想创始人团队在输出这些文化时，他们自己可能真的是相信这些，那些都是他们追求的梦想。但现在阿里的中高层，相信这些文化的比例可能很少。

在阿里，你如果想获得一些发展，除了基本的专业能力外，必备技能一定需要有“良好的沟通能力和向上管理能力”，也许你会说大部分公司也一样，但阿里管理者在这两方面的能力肯定是处于行业 top 的序列。在业务逐渐成熟，增量有限的情况下，这是一些管理者的求生之道。

再说回到技术，虽然在业务上有一些没落。但阿里在技术上确实做过长期投入的，比如阿里云；另外在业务迷茫期，支撑业务的技术团队也需要不断的想一些事情来做，以证明自己的价值。所以阿里的技术基建和氛围，比起腾讯，还是好不少。适合一些刚入职场，对技术特别感兴趣的同学。

## 求真务实的字节

由于字节大部分业务都处于发展期，所以和腾讯类似，团队协作都是以业务优先。但是不同于产品驱动的方式，字节的特点是数据驱动：基本上每一个需求，无论需求方是谁，业务，产品或者技术……都需要开 AB 实验，数据说话，只有数据正向需求才能上线。

这种近乎科学研究的方式，确保了对产品不断做正向迭代。公司层面自上而下对这种工作方式的共识，也使得产品优化的决策成本变得很小，一个基层员工也可以尝试对产品做出优化，只要数据正向，且不影响其他重要指标。

另外，字节整体保持了一家创业公司的危机感，通过季度 OKR 甚至双月 OKR 的快速迭代，员工从上至下都处于一种不安全感，危机感，需要不断自驱适应组织的预期。所以字节的离职率应该比腾讯和阿里要高的多。

## 一些建议

以下建议主要出于个人优势和喜好的考虑，如果未解答你的疑问，欢迎联系进一步交流

腾讯：

* 适合产品岗位同学
* 希望工作不那么卷的同学

阿里：

* 刚毕业希望积累技术的同学
* 表达沟通能力强，向上管理能力强，经验丰富的职场老鸟

字节：

* 对刚毕业的同学不友好，不培养人希望直接用有经验的
* 适合年轻，并且有一定经验，不怕卷的同学

## English Version

Having worked at several prominent tech companies in China for most of the past decade after graduation, I've been reflecting on what I've gained from these experiences and what advice I can offer to those seeking to join these "big tech" companies. Let me share my thoughts from my perspective.

## The Founders

When discussing a company, the founder is inevitably a central topic. The founder shapes a company's DNA. Pony Ma (Ma Huateng), Jack Ma (Ma Yun), and Zhang Yiming need no further introduction. However, let's revisit their careers before founding their respective companies: Ma Huateng and Zhang Yiming were software engineers, while Jack Ma was a university teacher. To some extent, this shaped the companies' genes and cultures.

## Tencent: Low-Profile and Pragmatic

When I first joined Tencent as a graduate, "user experience" was a common and frequently mentioned topic during orientation, as well as in exchanges with Pony Ma and other executives. As a newcomer with little experience, the company instilled the user-centric mindset in me. While this is undoubtedly beneficial, learning to think from a user's perspective alone may not suffice for personal growth without self-reflection. The emphasis on "user experience" in public forums lacked contextual development and prioritization notes.

Tencent is a product-driven company. Unless you're in a team focused on technical support, like TEG, as a tech engineer, your daily work will likely center on product development. Especially in the early stages of business development, the core technical goal is to support products and businesses. While this may seem universal, it's a norm at Tencent. As a tech professional, you have a unique advantage to develop a business sense and learn product thinking. However, such advantages may not be typical traits required of a tech expert or manager in the industry. You must continuously consider how to deliver value through technology. Within the company, however, helping businesses achieve rapid implementation or breakthroughs can lead to growth and promotion.

## Alibaba: Outgoing and Enthusiastic

If Tencent is described as introverted and socially anxious in human terms, Alibaba is certainly extroverted and socially confident, evident in its organizational culture and strong team collaboration.

Every new employee attends Alibaba's "Century-Old" orientation, where the company's entire development journey—from China Yellow Pages to Alibaba's founding, to Taobao, Tmall, and Alipay—is presented in films, akin to a blockbuster, inspiring and exciting to watch. The mission of "Making it Easy to Do Business Anywhere" and the "Six Core Values" preached by executives ignite passion in everyone, making them feel they are doing something meaningful and making a positive change in the world.

When the founder team conveys this culture, they likely truly believe in it, as it aligns with their dreams. However, among Alibaba's middle and senior management today, the proportion who believes in this culture may be small.

To advance in Alibaba, besides basic professional skills, essential abilities include "good communication skills and upward management." While these may be common in most companies, Alibaba's managers excel in these areas, ranking among the industry's top. As businesses mature with limited growth, these skills are crucial for managers' survival.

Regarding technology, despite some decline in business relevance, Alibaba has made long-term investments, like Alibaba Cloud. During business uncertainty, tech teams need to continuously innovate to prove their value. Therefore, Alibaba's tech infrastructure and atmosphere are better than Tencent's, suitable for tech-enthusiastic newcomers.

## ByteDance: Truth-Seeking and Pragmatic

Since most of ByteDance's businesses are in the growth stage, like Tencent, team collaboration prioritizes business. However, unlike product-driven approaches, ByteDance is characterized by data-driven decision-making: essentially, every request, regardless of the requester (business, product, or tech), requires an A/B test. Decisions are based on data, and only positive-impact requests are launched.

This scientific approach ensures continuous positive iterations. Consensus from top to bottom on this working style minimizes decision-making costs for product optimization. Even junior employees can attempt optimizations, as long as data shows positive impacts without affecting other key indicators.

Moreover, ByteDance maintains a startup's sense of crisis, with quarterly or even bi-monthly OKRs driving rapid iterations. Employees, from top to bottom, feel insecure and need to constantly adapt to organizational expectations. Consequently, ByteDance's turnover rate is likely higher than Tencent's and Alibaba's.

## Advice

The following advice is based on personal strengths and preferences. If your questions aren't answered, feel free to reach out for further discussion.

Tencent:

* Suitable for those in product roles.

* Ideal for those who prefer a less competitive work environment.

Alibaba:

* Ideal for graduates seeking to build tech skills.

* Suitable for experienced professionals with strong communication and upward management skills.

ByteDance:

* Not ideal for fresh graduates; prefers experienced candidates.

* Suitable for young, experienced professionals who aren't afraid of competition.
